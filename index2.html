          is an Italian luxury sports car manufacturer based in Maranello, Italy.
           Founded by Enzo Ferrari in 1939 from the Alfa Romeo racing division as Auto Avio Costruzioni, the company built its first car in 1940, and produced its first Ferrari-badged car in 1947.
        </p>
          <p> acquired 50% of Ferrari in 1969 and expanded its stake to 90% in 1988.[4] In October 2014, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) announced its intentions to separate Ferrari S.p.A. from FCA; 
            as of the announcement FCA owned 90% of Ferrari.[5][6][7] The separation began in October 2015 with a restructuring that established Ferrar</p>
          <p>
            N.V. (a company incorporated in the Netherlands) as the new holding company of the Ferrari S.p.A. group,[8] and the subsequent sale by FCA of 10% of the shares in an IPO and concurrent listing of common shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
             Through the remaining steps of the separation, FCA's interest in Ferrari's business was distributed to shareholders of FCA, with 10% continuing to be owned by Piero Ferrari.[10] The spin-off was completed on the 3rd of January 2016.

 <p>Ferdinand Porsche founded the company called "Dr. Ing. h. c. F. Porsche GmbH"[3] with Adolf Rosenberger[4] and Anton Piëch in 1931.
   [5] The main offices was at Kronenstraße 24 in the centre of Stuttgart.[6] Initially, the company offered motor vehicle development work and consulting,[3] but did not build any cars under its own name.
 </p>
   <p>  One of the first assignments the new company received was from the German government to design a car for the people; that is, a Volkswagen.
     [3] This resulted in the Volkswagen Beetle, one of the most successful car designs of all time.[7] The Porsche 64 was developed in 1939 using many components from the Beetle.[3]</p>
