  <h2>Cars Industry</h2>

  <p>
    automotive industry, all those companies and activities involved in the manufacture of motor vehicles, including most components, such as engines and bodies, but excluding tires, batteries, and fuel. The industry’s principal products are passenger automobiles and light trucks, including pickups, vans, and sport utility vehicles. Commercial vehicles (i.e., delivery trucks and large transport trucks, often called semis), though important to the industry, are secondary

  <p>The design of modern automotive vehicles is discussed in the articles automobile, truck, bus, and motorcycle; automotive engines are described in gasoline engine and diesel engine. The development of the automobile is covered in transportation, history of: The rise of the automobile.</p>

<p>
  The history of the automobile industry, though brief compared with that of many other industries, has exceptional interest because of its effects on history from the 20th century. Although the automobile originated in Europe in the late 19th century, the United States completely dominated the world industry for the first half of the 20th century through the invention of mass production techniques. In the second half of the century the situation altered sharply as western European countries and Japan became major producers and exporters

<p>there was widespread experimentation with steam and electricity. For a brief period the electric automobile actually enjoyed the greatest acceptance because it was quiet and easy to operate, but the limitations imposed by battery capacity proved competitively fatal. Especially popular with women, electric cars remained in limited production well into the 1920s. One of the longest-surviving makers, Detroit Electric Car Company, operated on a regular basis through 1929.</p>

  <h1 style="text-align:center;font-size:25px;background-color:black;color: aliceblue; "> Top  Car Manufacturers in the World</h1>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h1 style="text-align:center;font-size:25px ;" > 1-Toyota</h1>
 <a href="https://www.toyota.com/" target="_blank">   <img class="image" src="cars4.jpg" alt=""></a>
  
<p>Toyota is number one on this list once more, after wrestling top spot back from Volkswagen. The Japanese company, who last peaked the list in 2018, made a total revenue of just over $275 billion in 2020. The carmaker actually achieved higher revenue than in 2019, by about $3 billion, selling 9.5 million vehicles in the process. This included numerous Toyota Corollas, the best-selling car in the world.</p>


<br>
<br>
<h1 style="text-align:center;font-size:25px ;" > 2-Volkswagen </h1>
  <a href="https://www.vw.com/en.html" target="_blank"><img class="image" src="cars5.jpg" alt=""></a>
<p>Volkswagen is down one place, after topping this list last year. A revenue of €223 billion ($254 billion) in the midst of a global pandemic isn’t bad though, even if the German manufacturer did manage around $300 billion of sales in 2019. In total, the company sold about 9.3 million units of the various cars in its group, which features 12 brands, including Audi, Skoda and Porsche.</p>

<h1 style="text-align:center;font-size:25px ;" > 3-Mercedes-Benz </h1>
<a href="https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/"target="_blank"> <img class="image" src="cars6.jpg" alt=""> </a> 
<p>A potential surprise at number three, until you remember that one of the subsidiaries of the German carmaker is the world-famous luxury brand Mercedes-Benz. The manufacturer, who also produce Smart cars, turned over €154.3 billion ($184 billion dollars) last year, enough to retain its position on this list.</p>

<br>
<h1 style="text-align:center;font-size:25px ;" > 4-Honda </h1>
 <a href="http://www.honda.com/" target="_blank"><img class="image" src="cars7.jpg" alt=""></a>
<p>Up two places from last year, Honda turned in a revenue of $137 billion dollars in 2020. The Japanese manufacturer made just $6 billion dollars less than in 2019, despite a global pandemic, although it wasn’t enough to even make them the highest earning carmakers in their own country…</p>

<h1 style="text-align:center;font-size:25px ;" >5-Ford </h1>
<a href="https://www.ford.com/" target="_blank"> <img class="image" src="cars8.jpg" alt=""></a>
<p>General Motors drops one place from 2019 after turning over $122 billion in 2020. The American manufacturers, who sold around 6.8 million Chevrolets, Buicks, GMCs and Cadillacs in total last year, have been pipped this time by another little-know car company also based in Detroit…</p>
